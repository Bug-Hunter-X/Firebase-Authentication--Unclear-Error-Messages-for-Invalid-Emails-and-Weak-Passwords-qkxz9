The Firebase Authentication SDK might throw an error if the user's email address is not properly formatted or if the password does not meet the required complexity criteria.  For instance, if a user enters a password that is too short or lacks sufficient complexity, the `createUserWithEmailAndPassword()` method will throw an error. Similarly, an incorrectly formatted email address can lead to authentication failure.  The error messages are sometimes not very descriptive, making debugging difficult. This example shows a common error when the email address is invalid:

```javascript
firebase.auth().createUserWithEmailAndPassword(email, password)
  .catch(error => {
    const errorCode = error.code;
    const errorMessage = error.message;
    console.error(errorCode, errorMessage);
    // Handle error appropriately. For example, display an error message to the user.
  });
```
