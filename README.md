# Firebase Authentication Error Handling

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using Firebase Authentication: unclear error messages related to invalid email addresses and weak passwords. The `authBug.js` file shows the original code that produces unhelpful error messages, while `authBugSolution.js` provides an improved solution with more informative error handling.
